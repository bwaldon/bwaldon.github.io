    abstract = "Our ability to limit the future spread of COVID-19 will in part depend on our understanding of the psychological and sociological processes that lead people to follow or reject coronavirus health behaviors. We argue that the virus has taken on heterogeneous meanings in communities across the United States and that these disparate meanings shaped communities{'} response to the virus during the early, vital stages of the outbreak in the U.S. Using word embeddings, we demonstrate that counties where residents socially distanced less on average (as measured by residential mobility) more semantically associated the virus in their COVID discourse with concepts of fraud, the political left, and more benign illnesses like the flu. We also show that the different meanings the virus took on in different communities explains a substantial fraction of what we call the {``}{''}Trump Gap{''}, or the empirical tendency for more Trump-supporting counties to socially distance less. This work demonstrates that community-level processes of meaning-making in part determined behavioral responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and that these processes can be measured unobtrusively using Twitter.",

    abstract = "Modern semantic analyses of epistemic language (incl. the modals must and might) can be characterized by the following {`}credence assumption{'}: speakers have full certainty regarding the propositions that structure their epistemic state. Intuitively, however: a) speakers have graded, rather than categorical, commitment to these propositions, which are often never fully and explicitly articulated; b) listeners have higher-order uncertainty about this speaker uncertainty; c) must p is used to communicate speaker commitment to some conclusion p and to indicate speaker commitment to the premises that condition the conclusion. I explore the consequences of relaxing the credence assumption by extending the argument system semantic framework first proposed by Stone (1994) to a Bayesian probabilistic framework of modeling pragmatic interpretation (Goodman and Frank, 2016). The analysis makes desirable predictions regarding the behavior and interpretation of must, and it suggests a new way of considering the nature of context and communicative exchange.",

  title={Symmetric alternatives and semantic uncertainty modulate scalar inference},

  abstract = {Scalar inferences are commonly assumed to involve both literal semantic interpretation and social cognitive reasoning. However, the precise way to characterize listeners’ representation of context - including the space of possible utterance alternatives as well as the space of possible conventional meanings associated with linguistic forms - is a matter of ongoing debate. We report a partial replication of a scalar inference priming study by Rees and Bott (2018), introducing a novel baseline condition against which to compare behavior across different priming treatments. We also investigate the effect of raising participants’ awareness of communicatively stronger alternatives that explicitly encode an exhaustive meaning (e.g. some but not all with respect to some). Our results suggest that exhaustive alternatives (which are ‘symmetric’ to canonical alternatives) can modulate the availability and strength of scalar inferences, and that semantic uncertainty is an independent channel through which scalar inferences are modulated. We discuss implications for theories of pragmatic competence.},

abstract = {The past 15 years have seen increasing experimental investigations of core pragmatic questions in the ever more active and lively field of experimental pragmatics. Within experimental pragmatics, many of the core questions have relied on the operationalization of the theoretical notion of `implicature rate'. Implicature rate based results have informed the work on acquisition, online processing, and scalar diversity, inter alia. Implicature rate has typically been quantified as the proportion of `pragmatic' judgments in two-alternative forced choice truth value judgment tasks. Despite its theoretical importance, this linking hypothesis from implicature rate to behavioral responses has never been extensively tested. Here we show that two factors dramatically affect the `implicature rate' inferred from truth value judgment tasks: a) the number of responses provided to participants; and b) the linking hypothesis about what constitutes a `pragmatic' judgment. We argue that it is time for the field of experimental pragmatics to engage more seriously with its foundational assumptions about how theoretical notions map onto behaviorally measurable quantities, and present a sketch of an alternative linking hypothesis that derives behavior in truth value judgment tasks from probabilistic utterance expectations.},

abstract = {Truth Value Judgment Task experiments (TVJTs) are a common means of investigating pragmatic competence, particularly with regards to scalar inference. We present a novel quantitative linking function from pragmatic competence to participant behavior on TVJTs, based upon a Bayesian probabilistic model of linguistic production. Our model captures a range of observed phenomena on TVJTs, including intermediate responses on a non-binary scale, population and individual-level variation, participant endorsement of false utterances, and variation in response due to so-called scalar diversity.},
