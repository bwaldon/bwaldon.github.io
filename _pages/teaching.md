While at Stanford, I’ve had the pleasure of TAing and grading for Judith Degen’s Intro to Psycholinguistics course (LINGUIST 145 / PSYCH 140) and guest lecturing multiple times in Cleo Condoravdi’s undergraduate seminar on linguistic meaning and legal interpretation (LINGUIST 30N).  

Prior to Stanford, I worked as an instructor for The Princeton Review, teaching the ACT (US college entrance exam) and GMAT (MBA program entrance exam).
