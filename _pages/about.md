I research the ways in which context, linguistic structure, and social cognition jointly enable successful linguistic communication. To better understand the division of labor between these three things, I've worked on a variety of topics including linguistic vagueness/imprecision, modality, and implicature. 

Recently, I’ve also become interested in discourse contexts - and features of contexts - that are often relegated to the margins of linguistic theory. Right now, I’m thinking a lot about statutory interpretation as well as the role of racial bias in pragmatic inference.

I’m currently in my 4th year of the Linguistics PhD program at Stanford University. My two qualifying paper projects were advised by Cleo Condoravdi and Judith Degen. Before coming to Stanford, I was a Fulbright scholar at Leibniz-ZAS Berlin and a BA student at UChicago.
